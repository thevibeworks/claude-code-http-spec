# ci-alert.sh — make a failing scheduled run impossible to miss.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci-alert.sh open <run-id>   # called on failure
#   scripts/ci-alert.sh close           # called on success
#
# This workflow runs weekly and failed eight of its last nine runs without
# anyone noticing: a red scheduled run produces no artifact and no
# notification, so silence looks exactly like success. The tripwire is a single tracking issue
# labelled `ci-failure` — opened on the first failure, commented on for each
# subsequent one, and closed automatically by the next green run.
#
# Deliberately bounded at one open issue. Dedup never uses the search API:
# its index lags writes by minutes, which is how a sibling repo once filed
# byte-identical duplicates 13 seconds apart. The REST list lags a write
# too, by a few seconds and unevenly (measured in claude-reads-hn on
# 2026-09-02: two opens one second apart made two issues, with or without
# the label filter). So: match on title OR label over the plain open-issues
# list, and before creating, poll for up to 15 s. Runs are a week apart, so
# the wait costs nothing on the path that matters.
#
# Adds no secrets — uses the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN via GH_TOKEN.
