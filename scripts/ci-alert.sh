# ci-alert.sh — make a failing scheduled run impossible to miss.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci-alert.sh open <run-id>   # called on failure
#   scripts/ci-alert.sh close           # called on success
#
# This workflow runs weekly and failed eight of its last nine runs without
# anyone noticing: a red scheduled run produces no artifact and no
# notification, so silence looks exactly like success. The tripwire is a single tracking issue
# labelled `ci-failure` — opened on the first failure, commented on for each
# subsequent one, and closed automatically by the next green run.
#
# Deliberately bounded at one open issue. Dedup uses the REST issue list
# filtered by label, never the search API: search indexing lags writes by
# minutes, which is how a sibling repo once filed byte-identical duplicates
# 13 seconds apart.
#
# Adds no secrets — uses the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN via GH_TOKEN.
